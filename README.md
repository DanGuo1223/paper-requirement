**Statement from Advisor:**  
> Dan's paper "Unsupervised segmentation of mass spectrometric ion images characterizes morphology of tissues" is accepted to ISMB 2019 in April. ISMB is a premier conference in bioinformatics and computational biology, with acceptance rate 18.9%.

>Dan was responsible for the vast majority of the work on this paper. She proposed the idea of single-ion image segmentation, developed the machine learning method, and implemented the data analysis workflow that relies on the method. She evaluated the proposed approach on both simulated data and experimental data. The experimental data were obtained from collaborators in Chemistry. Dan wrote the paper, which was then edited by me and other co-authors. 

>This work has contributed to the community of mass spectrometry imaging by providing quantitative method to extract spatial structure of single ion distribution.
